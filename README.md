# WeatherApp
Final Proj for mobile dev 
download all dependencies and use 'expo run' to start the project. There might be warning for versions not being up to date but it should be able to run . It should work for both andriod and ios. in the case the api does not work, there is a backup apikey under keys/weatherAPIKey.js where you can just comment out the current api key and uncomment the second apikey.
alternatively, "https://snack.expo.dev/@mochibunnyz/weatherapp-final" you can test on expo snacks only it will only work on the ios emulator on snacks but not for android.
